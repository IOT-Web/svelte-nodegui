Build **performant**, **native** and **cross-platform** desktop applications with **Node.js** and **Svelte**.üöÄ

Svelte NodeGUI is powered by **Svelte** and **Qt5** üíö which makes it CPU and memory efficient as compared to other chromium based solutions like electron. Svelte NodeGUI is essentially a Svelte renderer for [NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui).

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1024px-React-icon.svg.png" alt="" width="25"> If you are looking for the **React**-based version, check out: **[React NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui)**.

There is no dedicated documentation for Svelte NodeGUI yet, so please refer to the [React NodeGui](https://react.nodegui.org/) documentation website instead. Svelte NodeGUI implements exactly the same APIs as React NodeGUI ‚Äì literally a copy-paste, as you'll see in [src/dom/react-nodegui](src/dom/react-nodegui) ‚Äì so those docs are equally applicable.

## Features

-   üß¨ Cross platform. Should work on major Linux flavours, Windows and MacOS.
-   üìâ Low CPU and memory footprint. Current CPU stays at 0% on idle and memory usage is under 20mb for a hello world program.
-   üíÖ Styling with CSS (includes actual cascading). Also has full support for Flexbox layout (thanks to Yoga).
-   ‚úÖ Complete Nodejs api support (Currently runs on Node v12.x - and is easily upgradable). Hence has access to all nodejs compatible npm modules.
-   üé™ Native widget event listener support. Supports all events available from Qt / NodeJs.
-   üí∏ Can be used for Commercial applications.
-   üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Good Devtools support.
-   üìö Good documentation and website.
-   üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Good documentation for contributors.
-   ü¶πüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Good support for dark mode (Thanks to Qt).
-   üèÖFirst class Typescript support. (Works on regular JS projects too üòâ).

## Getting Started

-   For now, download a zip of this repo and copying the `demo` folder is the best way to scaffold a new project.
-   Read through the [React NodeGUI docs](https://react.nodegui.org/) (there are no Svelte NodeGui docs yet, but there should be little difference).
-   Checkout the examples: https://github.com/nodegui/examples .

## Installation

NodeGui requires CMake and Compilation Tools as it is a wrapper for a native C++ widget toolkit QT.
Detailed instructions here: https://www.sitepoint.com/build-native-desktop-gif-searcher-app-using-nodegui/

TL;DR:

### MacOS

```sh
brew install cmake
brew install make
```

### Windows

https://cmake.org/download/

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```sh
sudo apt-get install pkg-config build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake make
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

### Linux (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS)

```sh
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
sudo dnf groupinstall "C Development Tools and Libraries"
sudo dnf install mesa-libGL mesa-libGL-devel
```

Then install NodeGUI from your command line:

#### To install latest stable release:

```sh
# WARNING: Not yet published to npm. On the to-do list..!
npm install @nodegui/svelte-nodegui
```

#### To install the latest version available on master branch:

```sh
npm install https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui/releases/download/v0.0.0-latest-master/nodegui-master.tgz
```

or a shorter version:

```sh
npm i http://master-release.nodegui.org
```

If the installation fails to download the Qt binaries, a mirror can be used by setting the following environment variable and running the install command again:

```sh
QT_LINK_MIRROR=<alternative domain> # eg. QT_LINK_MIRROR=https://qt-mirror.dannhauer.de

npm install @nodegui/svelte-nodegui
```

See [FAQs](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui/tree/master/website/docs/faq.md#why-does-installation-fail-at-minimal-qt-setup) for more details.

## Docs for contributing

### Svelte NodeGUI

File issues and get in touch, and we can guide you to something broken that needs fixing!

### NodeGUI

Looking to contribute to NodeGUI? If you wish to implement a new widget/add more features and need help understanding the codebase, you can start here: [Contributing developer docs](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui/tree/master/website/docs/development).

Please read https://github.com/nodegui/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Building

`npm run build`

Optionally set `QT_INSTALL_DIR='/path/to/qt'` environment variable to build using your own version of Qt.

## Updating docs

`npm run docs`

then followed by:

`cd website && GIT_USER=<your_git_username> yarn deploy`

## Funding

As no funding infrastructure is in place for Svelte NodeGUI specifically, please consider supporting [NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui) instead, which would be just as productive!

## Special Thanks

-   [NodeGUI logo: Thanks to Vishwas Shetty from the Noun Project.](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui/blob/master/extras/legal/logo/thanks.md)
-   [halfnelson](https://github.com/halfnelson) for [Svelte Native](https://github.com/halfnelson/svelte-native), which Svelte NodeGUI forks (as it is an excellent example of building a custom Svelte renderer).
-   [rigor789](https://github.com/rigor789) for [NativeScript Vue Next](https://github.com/rigor789/nativescript-vue-next), from which Svelte NodeGUI takes (and adapts) its DOM implementation.
-   [a7ul](https://github.com/a7ul) for creating [NodeGUI](https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui) and unwittingly teaching me [how to build renderers](https://blog.atulr.com/react-custom-renderer-1/) in the first place.
